# syg's cook book

[link](https://sgauthier.fr/cook)

This is the blog publishing recipes from my [recipe repo](https://github.com/sylGauthier/recipes).

It is a fork from [Luke Smith's cooking website](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/based.cooking).

It contains only the tools for publishing, which consist in the Makefile, which
is a heavily modified version of [blogit](https://pedantic.software/git/blogit)
and HTML templates and CSS.
